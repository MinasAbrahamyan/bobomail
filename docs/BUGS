I think I actually introduced this bug when I simplified
the HTMLifying of email addresses, because I simplified
something into incorrectness.  Anyway, the problem is with
links that include &, like:
  http://somewhere.com/cgi-bin/page?id
The & is turned into &amp; in the <a hrefwhich breaks it.  Also, I think < isn't
+detected as an end-
of-link, which it should be.  (, {}, [], and perhaps :
should also be added (mimeviewer.py, line 164).  The &amp;
problem is probably just from using the wrong form of
quote -- or maybe Goto needs to unquote it differently.
