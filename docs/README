About BoboMail

BoboMail is a so called webmail application, which provides mail access 
through a web interface. 

It is distributed under the GNU GPL. See COPYING in the package
or go to http://www.gnu.org for details.

Current features:

* read, write, reply, forward, delete and bounce messages

* send and receive attachments

* decodes quoted-printable, base64 and uuencoded

* handles HTML-mails properly (with inline images!)

* does not need Javascript

* direct support for the following MIME types:
  message/rfc822, message/delivery-status, multipart/alternative,
  multipart/mixed, multipart/report, multipart/related, 
  multipart/digest, text/plain, text/html, text/x-vcard, image/jpeg, 
  text/rfc822-headers, image/png, image/x-xpixmap, image/gif

* works with POP3-servers and partially IMAP4 (spool-files under development)

* easy to modify and customize through HTML-templates

* modular design provides easy interface for other authentication
  methods and mail protocols

* provides optionally its own fast multithreading webserver (BoboMailHTTPD)

* multi-lingual support (i18n) - currently English, Brazilian Portuguese,
  Finish, Spanish and German

* and it's 100% Python :-)

The first version of BoboMail was used for about a year and a half in the 
intranet of the Computer Club Ostfriesland (one of Germany's largest computer
clubs, see http://www.cco-ev.de if you understand German). I wrote my own
webmailer, because at that time only some Perl scripts were available,
which were not easy to customize (e.g. German interface).

BTW: The name comes from Bobo - the former name of ZPublisher (the cgi
framework I use). If you have a better/cooler idea for a name let me know!

I hope you will find BoboMail usefull. Please send complaints (e.g. spelling 
mistakes), criticism, security advices, suggestions, praises and everything 
else to ich@henning-schroeder.de or visit me (Henning) on my personal webpage
at http://www.henning-schroeder.de/en


Important acknowledgement:
This product includes software developed by Digital Creations

The BoboMail distribution contains Zope's ZPublisher and ZTemplates. These
compoments underly the Zope Public License (ZPL). They are packages with
BoboMail for easier installation.


BoboMail is hosted at Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net). If you are
interested in BoboMail development please visit the its webpage at

Besides I want to make BoboMail even more modular so that my stuff can
be used for a mailinglist archiver or a web-forum.


Attention: I really would like to know where you will use BoboMail. Please
tell me your success stories :-)
