Installing BoboMail

 +----------------------------------WARNING------------------------------------+
 | BoboMail is currently in development and may be not usefull for end users.  |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

So, if you don't got scared, try the following steps:

1. The first thing you need is Python - the best programming language on earth.
   You can download Python from http://www.python.org. But probably it is
   bundled with your distribution if you are a Linux user.

2. Okay is Python installed? Then copy all the stuff into a directory, e.g.
   /usr/local/bobomail

3. To customize BoboMail and get it working, look into bobomailrc.py and change
   it for your needs (look for smtp_host, pop3_host, auth_host, domain, etc).

4. Either change the imagedir variable in bobomailrc or add something like
      Alias /bobomail/ "/usr/local/bobomail/images/"
   to your httpd.conf (for Apache servers)

5. Do a chmod 700 to the var-directory or chown it to the user and group for 
   cgi-scripts (look into httpd.conf for User and Group). Often it is 
   nobody.nobody (on RedHat) or wwwrun.nogroup (on SuSE). This
   is neccessary to store the logs files and the session data for the
   authenticated users. When you get a Zope-Error with permission denied,
   you probably did something wrong here.

6. type "make install" in the app dir. This will compile all Python files to
   speed up BoboMail.

7. Move bobomail.cgi to the cgi-bin directory of your webserver and edit
   the marked line in it.

8. Test it: Go to the URL http://localhost/cgi-bin/bobomail.cgi with your
   favorite web-browser and have fun.

You don't have a Apache? Okay, other servers work too, but you might try
BoboMailHTTPD.py which is even faster. The parameter -d suppresses the 
message output and will write it to a log file. You can run the server in
background. It will listen on port 9673 (change bobomailrc.httpd_port if
you like).

If you have a RedHat 6.2 system with Zope installed you can delete the
ZPublisher and ZTemplates directory. This will speedup BoboMail because
the already installed components make use of C modules.


Addendum.

You may find it necessary to change the line reading
  #!/usr/bin/env python
to
  #!/usr/local/bin/python
in bobomail.cgi
