# bobomail
Bobomail made to work, an archaic webmail-on-Python project of 2002 

Original project URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/bobomail/

It had many bugs from point of view of modern Python 2.7 and of ZPublisher of Zope

Regretefully it doesn't support IMAP, nor POP3 with SSL, so it remains useless to me at the moment
